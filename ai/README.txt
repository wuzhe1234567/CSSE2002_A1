While the use of generative AI for this assignment is discouraged, I chose to use ChatGPT to assist with understanding the requirements and to generate some initial code samples. This document explains how the AI tool was used and where to find the logs of the interactions.

1. AI Tool Used:
   - ChatGPT (https://openai.com/chatgpt)

2. How ChatGPT Was Utilized:
   - I used ChatGPT to clarify assignment requirements.
   - It assisted in generating the initial implementation of certain classes (e.g., GameController.java) and helped adjust the code style.
   - All questions and answers exchanged with ChatGPT are documented in the log file provided.

3. Log Files:
   - The file `chatgpt_log.txt` in this folder contains a complete log of the questions asked and answers received during the development of this assignment.
